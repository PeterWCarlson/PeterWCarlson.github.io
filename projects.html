    <h2>Endeavor One (2017 – 2025)</h2>
    <p>Employee #1. Built and led the Design team through multiple VR titles.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dadLtfngQH8" target="_blank">Batman: Arkham Shadow</a></strong> (Quest 3): Designed and prototyped a series of minigames and led the E1 Design team as they did more impactful work.</li>
      <li><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOs66S6zWKM" target="_blank">Iron Man VR</a></strong> (Quest 2): Assisted Camouflaj in porting their successful PSVR game to Quest2. I did level design, scripting, encounter rebalancing, narrative setup and tweaking, and bug fixes. Owned this work for 1/3rd of the game levels.</li>
      <li><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDcNZ_BgDTY" target="_blank">Arashi: Castles of Sin</a></strong>  (PSVR): In addition to leading the Design team, I did all of the Systems Design and implemented a lot of functionality in C#</li>
      <li><strong><a href="DomeOfTheDead.mp4" target="_blank">Dome of the Dead</a></strong> (Vulcan HoloDome): Led Design, but also wrote all the AI movement and combat systems, built the enemy prefabs, built the animation graphs, set up the encounters, lots more.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFj6IQB76B4" target="_blank"><strong>Halo: Recruit</strong></a> (MS Mixed Reality):
This app was a shooting gallery to demonstrate Windows MR. I designed,
then created the art and game code for the playable portion of the demo.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Microsoft (2012 – 2016)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>HoloLens Experiences</strong>: For each of these, I
created paper designs and worked with the team to build and iterate. I
also built scenes, laid out menus, wrote presentation scripts, and
snuck in some C# here and there. With the exception of Minecraft, these
were all done in Unity.
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgakdcEzVwg&amp;t=146s" target="_blank"><strong>Minecraft</strong>:</a> Worked on two demos,
one which was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRQv74J7oSk&amp;t=57s" target="_blank">smoke and mirrors</a> and one which was running actual
Minecraft code. The first was at Hololens announce, the second was on
stage at E3.</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDkEJ3P2q9M" target="_blank"><strong>Galaxy Explorer</strong></a>: We asked the
community to suggest a project, which we then built in 6 weeks. We
documented the process with videos and released the code and content as
Open Source.</li>
      <li><strong>Behind Closed Doors</strong>: MR explorations shown
behind closed doors, including Halo, Ori and the Blind Forest, State of
Decay, Star Wars, Pixar Battlesaurs, and Disney Infinity.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90vnJ_cNKf0" target="_blank"><strong>Xbox Fitness</strong></a>: I defined our
telemetry captures and used the data to redesign the UI. I worked with
Bing Health and MS Band to get our products to play nicely together. I
oversaw a video shoot for a Paul George NBA workout video. I worked
with a third-party studio in Canada to do a mobile port. I also did
random things like writing Perl scripts to analyze and re-balance our
effort crediting system</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vD1ehxtNODY" target="_blank"><strong>Project Spark</strong></a>: Designed tutorial
and Kinect motion capture systems. Built two E3 showcase games</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz7wLcd0XsY" target="_blank"><strong>Nike+ Kinect Training</strong></a>: Led design
of DLC and Title Update (paper design)</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXpyeTvH8X0" target="_blank"><strong>Kinect PlayFit</strong></a>: Targeted overhaul
of Kinect PlayFit to get it to a shippable state on a very short
timeline.</li>
    </ul>
