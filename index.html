<h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
<div class="overview-point">
<p>● My most defining trait is integrity. I live my life based on it
and I built my Design team with that as our core value. That means
always being forthright, always operating in good faith, and being as
transparent as possible. If you look at the recommendations that my
Designers and cross-discipline teammates wrote for me on LinkedIn, I
think they show that it’s a great way to run a team.</p>
</div>
<div class="overview-point">
<p>● The other side of me, though, loves to be hands-on. I will always
think of myself as an explorer, hacker, and tinkerer. I love learning
new things, working with new tech, getting things to work, and solving
Design problems that no one has solved before. I can’t help messing
around with interesting things, so I’ve also ended up self-publishing
five titles in my spare time. </p>

2017 - Jan 2025</span> </div>
<div class="job-description">
<p>Endeavor One is a small but mighty VR studio. I was employee #1 and
wore a ton of hats. Over the past eight years I built a Design team
that I'm incredibly proud of.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Unannounced Title</strong> (Quest 3, PCVR): Lead the
Design department, gave design direction, created prototypes and pitch
materials, did level and encounter design, so many other things!</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dadLtfngQH8&amp;pp=ygUUYmF0bWFuIGFya2hhbSBzaGFkb3c%3D" target="_blank"><strong>Batman: Arkham Shadow</strong> </a>(Quest 3):
Worked with Camouflaj to design and prototype a series of minigames
("rat's nests") and led the E1 Design team as they did more impactful
work.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOs66S6zWKM" target="_blank"><strong>Marvel's Iron Man VR</strong></a> (Quest 2):
Assisted Camouflaj in porting their successful PSVR game to Quest2. I
did mostly level design, scripting, encounter rebalancing, narrative
setup and tweaking, and bug fixes. Owned this work for 1/3rd of the
game levels.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDcNZ_BgDTY" target="_blank"><strong>Arashi: Castles of Sin</strong></a> (PSVR): In
addition to leading the Design team, I did all of the Systems Design
and implemented a lot of functionality in C#.</li>
  <li><a href="DomeOfTheDead.mp4" target="_blank"><strong>Dome of the
Dead</strong></a> (Vulcan HoloDome): Led Design, but also wrote all the
AI movement and combat systems, built the enemy prefabs, built the
animation graphs, set up the encounters, lots more.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFj6IQB76B4" target="_blank"><strong>Halo: Recruit</strong></a> (MS Mixed Reality):
This app was a shooting gallery to demonstrate Windows MR. I designed,
then created the art and game code for the playable portion of the demo.</li>

– Oct 2016</span> </div>
<div class="job-description">
<p>On Xbox Fitness I led a team of 5 Designers, while on many of the
Hololens projects I was the sole Designer, usually working with a team
of 5-15 other people.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>HoloLens Experiences</strong>: For each of these, I
created paper designs and worked with the team to build and iterate. I
also built scenes, laid out menus, wrote presentation scripts, and
snuck in some C# here and there. With the exception of Minecraft, these
were all done in Unity.
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgakdcEzVwg&amp;t=146s" target="_blank"><strong>Minecraft</strong>:</a> Worked on two demos,
one which was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRQv74J7oSk&amp;t=57s" target="_blank">smoke and mirrors</a> and one which was running actual
Minecraft code. The first was at Hololens announce, the second was on
stage at E3.</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDkEJ3P2q9M" target="_blank"><strong>Galaxy Explorer</strong></a>: We asked the
community to suggest a project, which we then built in 6 weeks. We
documented the process with videos and released the code and content as
Open Source.</li>
      <li><strong>Behind Closed Doors</strong>: MR explorations shown
behind closed doors, including Halo, Ori and the Blind Forest, State of
Decay, Star Wars, Pixar Battlesaurs, and Disney Infinity.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90vnJ_cNKf0" target="_blank"><strong>Xbox Fitness</strong></a>: I defined our
telemetry captures and used the data to redesign the UI. I worked with
Bing Health and MS Band to get our products to play nicely together. I
oversaw a video shoot for a Paul George NBA workout video. I worked
with a third-party studio in Canada to do a mobile port. I also did
random things like writing Perl scripts to analyze and re-balance our
effort crediting system</li>
