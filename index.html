    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My most defining trait is integrity. I live my life based on it
and I built my Design team with that as our core value. That means
always being forthright, always operating in good faith, and being as
transparent as possible. If you look at the recommendations that my
Designers and cross-discipline teammates wrote for me on LinkedIn, I
think they show that it’s a great way to run a team.</p>
    <p>The other side of me, though, loves to be hands-on. I will always
think of myself as an explorer, hacker, and tinkerer. I love learning
new things, working with new tech, getting things to work, and solving
Design problems that no one has solved before. I can’t help messing
around with interesting things, so I’ve also ended up self-publishing
five titles in my spare time.</p>
