        <h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
        <div class="overview-point">
            <p>● My most defining trait is integrity. I live my life based on it and I built my Design team with that as our core value. That means always being forthright, always operating in good faith, and being as transparent as possible. If you look at the recommendations that my Designers and cross-discipline teammates wrote for me on LinkedIn, I think they show that it's a great way to run a team.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="overview-point">
            <p>● Having said that, I never thought of myself as a manager- I will always think of myself as a hacker and tinkerer. I love working with new tech, getting things to work, and solving Design problems that no one has solved before. I can't help messing around with interesting things, so I've also ended up self-publishing five titles in my spare time.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="overview-point">
            <p>● At this stage in my career I have a lot of gamedev, leadership, and VR/MR experience, but I love pushing technical boundaries so I'm really interested in new tech with unexplored Design challenges. Right now that sounds a lot like generative AI, and in fact I've been making some hobbyist apps integrating local LLM's in Unity just to keep learning.</p>

                <p>Endeavor One is a small but mighty VR studio. I was employee #1 and wore a ton of hats. Over the past eight years I built a Design team that I'm incredibly proud of.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Unannounced Title</strong> (Quest 3, PCVR): Lead the Design department, gave design direction, created prototypes and pitch materials, level and encounter design, so many other things!</li>
                    <li><strong>Batman: Arkham Shadow</strong> (Quest 3): Worked with Camouflaj to design and prototype a series of minigames ("rat's nests") and led the E1 Design team as they did more impactful work.</li>
                    <li><strong>Marvel's Iron Man VR</strong> (Quest 2): Assisted Camouflaj in porting their successful PSVR game to Quest2. I did mostly level design, scripting, encounter rebalancing, narrative setup and tweaking, and bug fixes. Owned this work for 1/3rd of the game levels.</li>
                    <li><strong>Arashi: Castles of Sin</strong> (PSVR): In addition to leading the Design team, I did all of the Systems Design and implemented a lot of functionality in C#.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dome of the Dead</strong> (Vulcan HoloDome): Led Design, but also wrote all the AI movement and combat systems, built the enemy prefabs, built the animation graphs, set up the encounters, lots more.</li>
                    <li><strong>Halo: Recruit</strong> (MS Mixed Reality): This app was a shooting gallery to demonstrate Windows MR. I designed, then created the art and game code for the playable portion of the demo.</li>

                <p>On Xbox Fitness I led a team of 5 Designers, while on many of the Hololens projects I was the sole Designer, usually working with a team of 5-15 other people.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>HoloLens Experiences</strong>: For each of these, I created paper designs and worked with the team to build and iterate. I also built scenes, laid out menus, wrote presentation scripts, and snuck in some C# here and there. With the exception of Minecraft, these were all done in Unity.
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Minecraft</strong>: Worked on two demos, one which was smoke and mirrors and one which was running actual Minecraft code. The first was at Hololens announce, the second was on stage at E3.</li>
                            <li><strong>Galaxy Explorer</strong>: We asked the community to suggest a project, which we then built in 6 weeks. We documented the process with videos and released the code and content as Open Source.</li>
                            <li><strong>Behind Closed Doors</strong>: MR explorations shown behind closed doors, including Halo, Ori and the Blind Forest, State of Decay, Star Wars, Pixar Battlesaurs, and Disney Infinity.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Xbox Fitness</strong>: I defined our telemetry captures and used the data to redesign the UI. I worked with Bing Health and MS Band to get our products to play nicely together. I oversaw a video shoot for a Paul George NBA workout video. I worked with a third-party studio in Canada to do a mobile port. I also did random things like writing Perl scripts to analyze and re-balance our effort crediting system</li>
